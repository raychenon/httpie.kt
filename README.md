You should use Kotlin - or your favorite language - to script and automate all the things.

Not Bash.

Modern programming language are an order of magnitude better than Bash.

There are only two good kind of Bash scripts:
- the ones that are five lines long or less
- the ones that are written and maintained by others

This repo is two things:

- a reimplementation in Kotlin Multi-platform of a real world CLI tool: [git-standup](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup)
- a GitHub template to give you the inspiration to write your own command line tools in Kotlin and to get you started faster

## Work in progress

We want to support Windows, publish on Homebrew and simplify support of shell completion. 

Look at the issues https://github.com/jmfayard/kotlin-cli-starter/issues

## Try it out!

You can install using one of the options listed below

| Source | Command |
| --- | --- |
| curl | `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmfayard/kotlin-cli-starter/main/installer.sh \| sudo sh` |
| Kotlin Native | Clone, run `./gradlew install` then `$ git standup` |
| Kotlin JVM | Clone and run `./gradlew run` |
| Tests | `./gradlew allTests` |

## What the template contains

The template

- can be run both
  - with Kotlin/Native via `$ ./gradlew install` and then `git-standup`
  - on the JVM with `$ ./gradlew run`
- has tests that can also be run both
  - natively `$ ./gradlew nativeTest`
  - on the JVM `$ ./gradlew desktopTest`
- has continuous integration powered by GitHub actions. The code and the tests are run both on native and on the JVM, both on Ubuntu and macOS. See [.github/workflows/runOnGitHub.yml](https://github.com/jmfayard/kotlin-cli-starter/blob/main/.github/workflows/runOnGitHub.yml)  
- includes those libraries
  - [kotlin.test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/) for multi-platform testing
  - [CliKt](https://github.com/ajalt/clikt) which parses the command-line arguments in a typesafe way and automatically generates the help and Bash/Zsh/Fish auto-completion
  - [ktor-client](https://ktor.io/docs/getting-started-ktor-client.html) to make HTTP calls
  - [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) which provides Kotlin multiplatform / multi-format serialization
  - [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
  - [gradle refreshVersions](https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions/) to simplify dependency management
- contains an API to work with Files and execute shell subcommands.

## The template reimplements `git-standup`

The template reimplement [`git-standup`](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup) so that you can learn and find inspiration from a real world example.

Simply run it in and it will give you the output from the last working day

Open a directory having multiple repositories and run

```shell
$ ./gradlew install
$ git standup
```

![git standup](http://i.imgur.com/4xmkA49.gif)

This will show you all your commits since the last working day in all the repositories inside.

Options:

```shell
git standup --help
Usage: git-standup [OPTIONS]

  Recall what you did on the last working day ..or be nosy and find what
  someone else did.

Options:
  --generate-completion [bash|zsh|fish]
  -a, --author TEXT                Specify author to restrict search to

                                   repositories)

```
